## 👋 About Me

Hello! I’m the creator and guide behind **CodeSutraHub**. My journey weaves together advanced lighting and animation technology with the pragmatic world of software automation and AI-driven solutions.

### 🎬 Industry Experience  
Currently, I serve as a **Lighting Technical Supervisor at DNEG**, blending the art and science of animation with deep technical expertise. Over the years, I’ve architected tools, automated workflows, and streamlined pipelines using Python and diverse APIs. My day-to-day is a blend of technical artistry, engineering best practices, and product-centric thinking.

### 🛠️ My Tech Philosophy  
My driving passion is bringing clarity and scale to complex software problems. I believe solutions should be powerful yet simple—much like the Sanskrit concept of a _sutra_: a concise thread of logic that brings ideas together. Whether automating laborious tasks, building robust APIs, or infusing workflows with AI, I focus on making technology both accessible and transformative.

### 🌱 Always Evolving  
While my roots are in the animation and VFX industry, I’m continually expanding into new domains:
- **IT and Software Engineering**: Exploring enterprise workflow automation, SaaS, and cloud-native tools.
- **AI Product Management**: Fusing technical mastery with a user-focused product mindset, aspiring to become a world-class product manager and AI developer.
- **Side Hustles & Collaboration**: Open to new opportunities and income streams by leveraging my skills for broader impact.

### 🤝 Let’s Build the Future  
CodeSutraHub is both a portfolio and a public lab—a space for sharing knowledge, open-source collaboration, and building the next generation of smart tools.  
If you’re a fellow engineer, developer, or product enthusiast, I invite you to join, contribute, and co-create with me.
