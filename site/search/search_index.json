Small to mid-size studios wanting consistency. Educational setups for teaching clean project management. How to use it Steps to create hierarchy Copy project_hierarchy.bat to the new shared drive created in your google workspace Then double click on that .bat file and it will create all the project folders for you Steps to modify hierarchy If you want to change anything in hierarchy just update project_hierarchy.json for main folders. And for each asset and shot hierarchy we need to modify assets_hierarchy.json and shots_hierarchy.json respectively. Those json files are preety straight forward for root folder just change the root key value, for main folder change name key value and for subfolders change the name inside subfolder list. We can also add copy_files keys if we want to copy some basic files by default to any folder created.
