And for each asset and shot hierarchy we need to modify assets_hierarchy.json and shots_hierarchy.json respectively. Those json files are preety straight forward for root folder just change the root key value, for main folder change name key value and for subfolders change the name inside subfolder list. We can also add copy_files keys if we want to copy some basic files by default to any folder created.
